# Fire
An example of a more thorough look into predicting fires in northeast Portugal.

Find the dataset used [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/) and the starting code for SKLearn [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVR.html)


_Requirements_ 

*Python 2.7.x
*[SKLearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
*[Numpy](http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy) _"Shouldn't you already have that installed?"_
*For the love of god, an OSX machine

**Special thanks to Cortez and Morais for their data collection and work as well as the UCI Machine Learning Repository**


##Overview
First and foremost, nothing has been written here that has not already been investigated by Cortez and Morais in their generous donation of the above-referenced data set out of the UCI Machine Learning repository.  I instead sought to expand their classification system employed to move away from a regression system instead to a more classification-oriented design that seeks to output a _'level of severity'_ of fire as opposed to continuous prediction of land area burned.
